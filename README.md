# INTEGRATED CROP PROTECTION MANAGEMENT


In response to the unpredictable climatic conditions and pest attacks on crops, this project aims to create an integrated model that can assist farmers in detecting plant diseases and identifying pests. This technology will help farmers make informed decisions about crop management, reduce crop losses, and minimize the use of chemicals in agriculture. The proposed integrated model will utilize Deep Learning algorithms and image recognition techniques to accurately identify pests and plant diseases, making it a valuable tool for farmers worldwide.
